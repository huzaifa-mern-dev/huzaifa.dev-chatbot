# **App Name**: DevChat

## Core Features:

- Chat Widget: Create a toggle-able chat widget that sits in the bottom right corner of the site.
- Responsive UI: Design a clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS for the chat window, including input fields, message display, and a clear call-to-action button.
- Gemini Integration: Integrate with the Gemini API to generate responses to user queries, simulating a conversation with a professional web developer. The LLM should act as a tool to help DevChat craft appropriate answers.
- Typing Indicator: Implement a typing indicator (loading animation) that displays while the bot is generating a response, giving the user feedback that the bot is working.
- Greeting Message: Display a greeting message when the chat widget is first opened to welcome the user and provide initial guidance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate gray (#334155) for a professional and modern feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F9FAFB) for backgrounds and subtle accents.
- Accent color: Teal (#14B8A6) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean and modern sans-serif font for readability.
- Use a consistent grid system and spacing throughout the chat interface.
- Simple, line-based icons for visual clarity.
- Subtle animations for transitions and loading states.
